# Preface

Thank you for picking up this book about Evolving Software.

Maybe you are interested in how Software is developed, maybe you are curious about the debates about testing raging on in the Software community, maybe you are a fellow student of the Universe and Nature as I am. I aim to be your guide on a journey of wonder, aiming to understand the context of Software and its place in the Natural Order, and I hope you find it as interesting as I do.

My internship and first job were in web development. It was 1995, and I didn't know what was going to happen, but I knew it'd be big. "Have you heard of the Internet? It's going to be the biggest thing since the printing press!", I eagerly told anyone who'd listen.

This book is the more nuanced examination of that statement. It expands upon it, and incorporates 20 years of knowledge I've been exposed to since then. This includes evolutionary biology, network and graph theory, chaos theory, dynamcal systems, fetal development, genetic algorithms, organizational paradigms, and a measure of my own anecdotal experiences thrown in, to keep it friendly.

I am in awe of the Software Animal, and how much about its development has already changed between now in 2014, and my beginning in its field almost 20 years ago.

This wonder may have started my freshman year, in a basement computer lab at Boston University. This was the fall of 1993. Knowing few people, and having access to a lab full of VT-100 green screens on one side and larger-than-Id-ever-seen 29" X-Windows Sun workstations on the other, I found myself poking around these systems quite a bit. I read my first emails there through a program called 'mail', and I surfed nntp:// and gopher:// through programs 'tin' and 'gopher'. Even then, there were cat jokes. I was happy :)

Then I accidentally discovered the World Wide Web. By pure chance, I launched a program called Mosaic. This was in fact, the first web browser, created in my home state of Illinois. Soon I was seeing satellite weather images from all different parts of the country! I had seen things like this in Encyclopedias, but these were timestamped to be like 3 minutes ago. Mind = blown. I looked around me - did other people know you could do this? Nobody told me this was happening just a few months ago in high-school. My quest for understanding had only begun.

20 years later, the Web has changed the planet, and in the next 20 years, it'll change even more, as I'll explain later in Growth Classes, Chapter G. Over the rest of our lives, the world of technology will turn over many, many times. The shorter the difference in time between "generations", the faster evolution can occur (Chapter E). I believe that by looking at the evolution of previous complex systems, we can learn a few things about how these types of systems grow (Evolution Chapter E). But more importantly, knowing the way things *want* to grow, if we are involved in growing them, is critical to using our energies correctly.

There's no shortage of people in the Software field who will tell you how to do things "the right way". Usually they are well-intentioned, and speak auto-biographically on what worked for them at some point. Occasionally they may even quote an incident or two that had empirical data! But what I ask of you is a bigger task than following my or anyone's advice - I ask you to conclude for yourself what is best, by learning from all that has grown in the past.

The world of Software is changing so rapidly that last year's advice may be expired by now. And too often, something with a good principle at its core like Test-Driven Development, gets turned into a caricature of itself and used to beat people over the head for reasons entirely unrelated to creating good Software. We need ways to find out for ourselves what Software wants and needs, not just pundits telling us to join the Cargo Cult (Chapter N). We should aspire to more than simply repeating others' opinions, loudly. Perhaps we are not the true creators of software anyway- maybe we are merely typing it in, but larger forces, evolutionary forces are driving the creation of exponentially more Software programs every year.

If you're not in this field, you may ask - Why is Software so important? To begin, Software is everything that you *can easily change*, while hardware is what you are stuck with for much longer. Everything in our heads that we know is Software! If you want to improve yourself, or the business you're in, or anything really, a focus on Software will yield results sooner, may be in fact the only thing you *can* change. We won't be rebuilding the entire Interstate system anytime soon, but we may achieve better traffic flow through Software optimization. Normal healthy humans are all similar-model smart-phones, but we vary in which apps are running on each of us. Learning how to keep Software healthy, is no less than learning how to focus on what we can change, and implementing a path of continual internal and external improvement.

A few words about generalization and metaphor: This book is rich in metaphor. At times, you may feel the metaphor is a stretch. And you have a choice how to respond. You can let your intellect reject the thought outright, or you can choose to sit with the thought in your head for a little while, giving it a chance to permeate and possibly create hybrid ideas with your own (Sexual Reproduction of Ideas Chapter X). Write a note about your disagreement to me or yourself, and vow to explore that later, but try to keep an open mind. Minds, like parachutes, function best when open (neuroscience Chapter N).

This may be a flight of fancy, but even if not, I invite you to join me in these fun juxtapositions. The greatest creative duos are often pairs of different personalities (Lennon-McCartney), and many of the greatest inventions were simply the swallowing of one idea by another - the network client and the HyperText engine in the case of NCSA Mosaic. So try absorbing new ideas as much as possible. Welcome to the Mad Garden - lets listen to the leaves and hear what they have to say!

A few words about Lean Publication: This book is a work in progress. The LeanPub platform is about incorporating review to make the best book it can be. So please give me your feedback. Embrace the fact that I have chosen to create a book that *wants to grow* and I have placed it in your hands where I hope its ideas will result in swallowing parts of your brain, and vice versa, until all of us are far greater than what I ever intended. It is already your book, dear readers, more than it is mine.
