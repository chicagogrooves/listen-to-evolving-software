# Preface

Thank you for picking up this book about evolving software.
Maybe you are interested in how Software is developed, maybe you are curious about the debates about testing raging on in the Software community, maybe you are a fellow student of the Universe and Nature as I am. I aim to be your guide on a journey of wonder, aiming to understand the context of Software and its place in the Natural order, and I hope you find it as interesting as I do.

My internship and first job were in web development, as early as 1995, and I didn't know what was going to happen, but I knew it'd be big. "Have you heard of the Internet? It's the biggest thing since the printing press." I eagerly told anyone who'd listen.

This book is the more nuanced examination of that statement. It expands upon it, and incorporates 20 years of knowledge I've been exposed to since then. This includes evolutionary biology, network and graph theory, chaos theory, dynamcal systems, fetal development, genetic algorithms, organizational paradigms, and a measure of my own anecdotal experiences thrown in, to keep it friendly.

I am in awe of the Software Animal, and how much about its development has already changed between now (2014), and the time of my beginning in its field in 1997.

This wonder may have started my freshman year, in a basement computer lab full of X-Windows terminals at Boston University. This was the fall of 1993. Knowing few people, and having access to a lab full of VT-100 green screens on one side and larger-than-Id-ever-seen 29" X-Windows Sun workstations on the other, I found myself poking around these systems quite a bit. I read my first emails ever there through a program called 'mail', and I surfed nntp:// and gopher:// through programs 'tin' and 'gopher'. There were cat jokes. I was happy.

Then I accidentally discovered the World Wide Web. By pure chance, while running programs randomly, I launched a program called Mosaic, the first web browser, created in my home state of Illinois, no less. Soon I was looking at satellite images over all different parts of the country. I had seen things like this in Encyclopedias, but these were timestamped to be like 3 minutes ago. Mind = blown ! I looked around me - did other people know you could do this? Nobody told me this was happening just a few months ago in high-school. My quest for understanding had only begun.

If you're a recent college grad, the amount of change that happened to me since my discovering the WWW as a freshman, to being a Senior Software Engineer will happen to you before you're 40 years old. In fact, it'll be more, as I'll explain later. in Growth Classes, Chapter G. And in the who-knows-how-many remaining years you will have, the world of technology will turn over many, many times. The shorter the difference in time between 'generations', the faster evolution can occur (Chapter E). I believe that by looking at the evolution of previous complex systems, we can learn a few things about how these types of systems grow (Evolution Chapter E). But more importantly, knowing the way things *want* to grow, if we are involved in growing them, is critical to using our energies correctly.

A few words about generalization and metaphor: This book is rich in metaphor. At times, you may feel the metaphor is a stretch. And you have a choice how to respond. You can let your intellect reject the thought outright, or you can choose to sit with the thought in your head for a little while, giving it a chance to permeate and possibly create hybrid ideas with your own (Sexual Reproduction of Ideas Chapter X). Write a note about your disagreement to me or yourself, and vow to explore that later, but try to keep an open mind. Minds, like parachutes, function best when open (neuroscience Chapter N).

This may be a flight of fancy, but even if not, I invite you to join me in these fun juxtapositions. The greatest creative duos are often twosomes of different personalities (Lennon-McCartney), and many of the greatest inventions were simply the swallowing of one idea by another - the network client and the HyperText engine in the case of NCSA Mosaic. So try absorbing new ideas as much as possible. Welcome to the Mad Garden - lets listen to the leaves and hear what they have to say!

A few words about Lean Publication: This book is a work in progress. The LeanPub platform is about incorporating review to make the best book it can be. So please give me your feedback. Embrace the fact that I, the author, have chosen to create a book that *wants to grow* and I have placed it in the primordial soup of LeanPub where I hope its random jostlings will result in it swallowing parts of your brain, and vice versa, until you, I, it are all far greater than what I ever intended. It is your book, collective readers, more than it is mine.
