# Preface

Thank you for picking up this book about evolving software.
Maybe you are interested in how complex software is developed...

Let me assure you, that as much as I may dissect the software beast, and analyze it down to its very essence, my feeling toward it is only one of wonder. Wonder which started my freshman year, in a basement computer lab full of X-Windows terminals (Not MS Windows, this actually preceded Windows-95 :). This was the fall of 1993, and I was new at Boston University. Knowing few people, and having access to a lab full of VT-100 green screens on one side and larger-than-Id-ever-seen 29" X-Windows Sun workstations on the other, I found myself poking around these systems quite a bit. I read my first emails ever there through a program called 'mail', and I surfed nntp:// and gopher:// through programs 'tin' and 'gopher'. There were cat jokes. I was happy.

Then I discovered the World Wide Web. By pure chance, while running programs randomly (in /usr/bin), I launched a program called Mosaic. Soon I was looking at satellite images over different parts of the country. I had seen things like this in Encyclopedias, but these were timestamped to be like 3 minutes ago. Mind = blown ! I looked around me - did other people know you could do this ?

My internship and first job were in web development, and I didn't know what was going to happen, but I enthusiastically told everyone I met that change was coming. "Have you heard of the Internet? It's the biggest thing since the printing press." This book is the more nuanced examination of that statement. It expands scope, and drops references to 20 years of knowledge I've been exposed to since then - including evolutionary biology, network and graph theory, chaos theory, dynamcal systems, fetal development, genetic algorithms, organizational paradigms, with a measure of my own anecdotal experiences thrown in, to keep it friendly.

If you're a recent college grad, the amount of change that happened to me since discovering the WWW as a freshman, to being a Senior Software Engineer (and more, of course, due to growth curves I'll describe in Chapter G) will happen to you before you're 40 years old. And in the who-knows-how-many remaining years you will have (life expectancy Chapter L), the world of technology will turn over many, many times. The shorter the difference in time between 'generations', the faster evolution can occur (Chapter E)

Whatever age you are, what kind of wonders might 5 or 10 years open up as the rate of growth increases ? What will this world look like ? Nobody can know (Unknowability in Chapter U). But I believe that by looking at the evolution of previous complex systems, we can learn a few things about these types of systems grow (Evolution Chapter E).

But more importantly, knowing the way things *want* to grow, if we are involved in growing them, is critical to using our energies correctly. This applies whether you're in a technical role or not - it's really about how connected information systems grow, and if your livelihood depends on connected information systems, I think it will pay to develop more ways of thinking about them.

A few words about Lean Publication: This book is a work in progress. The LeanPub platform is about incorporating review to make the best book it can be. So please give me your feedback. Embrace the fact that I, the author, have chosen to create a book that *wants to grow* and I have placed it in the primordial soup of LeanPub where I hope its random jostlings will result in it swallowing parts of your brain, and vice versa, until you, I, it are all far greater than what I ever intended. It is your book, collective readers, more than it is mine.

A few words about generalization and metaphor: This book is rich in metaphor. At times, you may feel the metaphor is a stretch. And you have a choice how to respond. You can let your intellect reject the thought outright, or you can choose to sit with the thought in your head for a little while, giving it a chance to permeate and possibly create hybrid ideas with your own (Sexual Reproduction of Ideas Chapter X). Write a note about your disagreement to me or yourself, and vow to explore that later, but try to keep an open mind. Minds, like parachutes, function best when open (neuroscience Chapter N).

Some have supposed that more than Software Writers, or Software Engineers, we are Software Gardeners. I like that metaphor, but unlike our individual gardens, the software we help to grow, if above a critical size, will *find new gardeners* if we stop gardening it. Not to alarm you, but ask yourself if the software of the company you work for would stop growing if you were to leave. Above a certain size, the answer is definitely no - the garden would *find a new gardener!*

This may be a flight of fancy, but even if not, I invite you to join me in these fun juxtapositions. The greatest creative duos are often twosomes of different personalities (Lennon-McCartney), and many of the greatest inventions were simply the swallowing of one idea by another - the network client and the HyperText engine in the case of NCSA Mosaic. So try absorbing new ideas as much as possible. Welcome to the Mad Garden, and lets listen to the leaves and hear what they have to say!
