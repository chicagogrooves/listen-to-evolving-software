# Evolution

## Not only for the living

Susan Blackmore lit my brain on fire with this section from her TED talk [^1]

> What Darwin said was something like this: **if you have creatures that vary**, and that can't be doubted -- I've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on. And 100 pages later. (Laughter) **And if there is a struggle for life, such that nearly all of these creatures die** -- and this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on. And another 100 pages later. **And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive**, then those offspring **must** be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were.

This is a nice synopsis of a rather large body of work, *Origin of Species*. And it lays the groundwork for the 3 necessary conditions for evolutionary change to occur. - inherited qualities aka heredity, variation, and selection. But she asserts that these are not only necessary, but sufficient conditions, and they apply to non-living things as well!

> What do you think my favorite word is?  **Must**! This is what makes it so amazing. You don't need a designer, or a plan, or foresight, or anything else. If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. You can't stop it. 

She then goes on to enumerate countless things- human ideas, which get copied and varied and selected for, and you start to see this evolutionary process occurring everywhere. It simply arises out of random jostlings, which feels to me a bit like watching a bag of chips separate while you shake it into large chips on top, and crumbs on the bottom. There may be people out there saying that "Big chips on top" is "the best layout", and others may suppose there exists a divine Chip Sorter[^2], but it's possible that this is just spontaneous order from chaos. 

## But, definitely for the living

If we fast-forward a few billion years in Earth's evolution, to the beginning of life, we'd find single-celled organisms. Some really interesting forms are skipped over, see Martin Hanczyc for details[^3]. Currently, there are people. Here's a few-billion year synopsis of that process.

* Single Cell
* Colony of cells (no communication)
* Organism (analog/chemically connected)
* Specialization, becoming.. 
* Organism with Nervous System (digital/electrically connected)

Chemical connection enabled colonies of cells to coordinate, thereby functioning as an organism. The economies of scale that brought them together could only keep them together if they could function as a unit. But as organisms got larger, chemical processes alone could not traverse the diameter of the organism quickly enough. 

Specialization - something that began once a colony of cells was large enough to have a distinction of internal-external, allowed the organism to undergo refactorings - internal reorganizations that don't change the outsid much. Different internal cells could try different roles, until a new class of cells emerged, neurons, which could transmit signals faster than before.

Just as a wave is merely a ripple in the state of a pond, just like AC current pushes waves of power without displacing electrons very far from where they start, nerve cells propogated changes of **chemical state**, not the chemicals themselves. And this faster signaling made organisms more responsive.

## Human colonies
As one follows the organism-evolution process, many variations of life - birds, lizards, dinosaurs occur, until the arrival of the first proto-humans. Lets see what happened next:

* Small tribes of humans
* Development of language
* Larger tribes (nations) of humans
* Writing down of information
* Electronic transmission of information

You see, the same improvements that occurred on the cellular level are occurring between organisms on this planet! The evolution of life is simply the evolution of complexity.. And we are speeding up the process.


## The acceleration of processes
If the earth's age is a year old, all human evolution occurs in the last second of the year. 

And yet in that brief time, humans have learned to fly airplanes, build the Internet, and build atomic bombs that could kill us all. This is but a blip in the timeline of human evolution itself - perhaps a millisecond out of the year. 

Progress builds on progress. And we are at a very interesting time of progress.

It used to be that the only way one generation of living things was enhanced was by the direct passing of genes. Then we evolved the ability to copy what others did by watching - teaching came of age. But it still required direct connection between teacher and student. Language enabled us to more compactly represent and recall our experiences, but only when we became able to write it down could we get teachings directly from those that were not around to teach them. 

Electronic transmission of information is again a game-changer. What Bill Gates called a Digital Nervous System, is functioning exactly as a biological nervous system - relaying messages by propogating changes of state instead of actual hard-copy! Humans are able to cluster along people of their interests over the internet no matter how far apart people with those interests may live. 

For this reason, I believe it is a fallacy to believe that we will breed ourselves into problems because the more well-to-do, more-educated people are having fewer children. Genetic information has long been superseded by written and digital information in the way that one generation shapes the next. Informational generations are getting shorter and shorter, while biological generations are lumbering along, and if anything getting longer. Exponential growth will have its way - it always does..
