#Dedication

This book is dedicated to my mother, Judith Lenore Davis Radcliffe (Jules).

Bringing up a curious, fidgety boy like me all on her own could never have been easy. It was from her that I learned to believe that a few core principles (being true to your word, fiscal responsibility, integrity), when practiced over and over, could produce net gains beyond your imaginings. The odds that I would have gotten a private-university education being an inner-city child of a single mom were astronomical. Thanks mom, for being aligned to the principles that were able to produce unexpected growth.

My wife-soon-to-be Jessica Kline bears the other honorable mention. Her commitment to me, and to the students to whom she is their guide to the wonderful world of Math, has also produced great gains all around. Since finding out that we are expecting our first child this year, all this talk of evolutionary biology really hits home, as we observe the self-organization of our child to be and all the refactorings going on in her body and our lives to support him or her. You have my love forever Jess !

Thanks also to: the friends with whom talking Math and Science was actually a fun way to spend the night, the colleagues who intrigued me and inspired new directions, and the greats of the field of Math, Computers and Complexity who've laid the foundwork for all that I humbly try to summarize.
