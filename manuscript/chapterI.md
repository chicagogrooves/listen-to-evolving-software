# Immune Systems

## Evolution of Furnaces

*"I understand a wood-burning fireplace, but why does the bill for fixing my furnace need to be so high?"*
- (Me, upon receiving the bill, and a great lesson in evolution)

Furnaces have developed immune systems. 

Do not be afraid, good people, they mean you no harm, but in fact they are far better protected then they were just a few decades back. 

They used to simply turn on an exhaust motor and start the ignition one right after each other when they got the signal to do so from the thermostat. Then, all of a sudden a new part appeared - the pressure sensor. Its function seemed mysterious until one day the exhaust vent got blocked. Air wasn't leaving, and pressure in the vent was higher than if air were leaving. 

And then we noticed that the pressure sensor under high pressure would break the circuit, preventing ignition. Ignition could only occur if air were leaving. And that's when we realized that this piece of its immune system is actually a Very Good Thing.


## Leaving its Mark

In Biology, an Immune System can be Passive, like a membrane, or Active like antibodies that directly interfere with particular invaders.

The Active Immune System has a kind of memory that passes down through generations. This is perhaps the earliest kind of "memory", where information is "written" and preserved chemically.

When you're born, you recieve certain antibodies from your mother's milk. That is a lesson you should be grateful for. Yet you will undoubtedly encounter strains of viruses or diseases that you have no antibody for yet. Assuming you survive the encounter, then - Congratulations! You are the proud winner of a new antibody! A 'chemical memory' of have having had that illness, written in the antibodies you possess!

The other kind of memory only takes place at the population level. When Bubonic Plauge eradicated more than half of Europe in the 1200's, those remaining survivors were alive partly because of a specific gene that helped them survive the illness. The next generation of Europeans had a considerably higher percentage of children born with that gene! 

So by direct biological response, and overall population response, immunities arise and are passed down through generations.

## Marks left in Software by other Software

Code examples posted on the internet explaining how to accomplish a task, usually bear the disclaimer **Not For Production Use**.

The kinds of things omitted, for clarity of explanation, but which would be needed in a production system are usually of a similar variety:

* Line endings on one system may be different from another
* Some systems use 32-bit, others use 64-bit integers
* Different web browsers render the same things differently

Typically, the longer a given Software Animal has been in the wild, the greater number of marks it has. These record their travels to various places where they accumulate scars, acquire and recover from diseases, etc. 

Web software is notorious for having to run in many different places - on your phone, then your Apple tablet, then your work computer, then your partner's Android phone. While the essential functions of a Software Animal may evolve on a certain schedule, the marks of adaptation due to exposure occur on their own schedule related more to the environment than sources within.

That's one thing we mean by **robust** software. It's been vetted in a number of ways, and each time it's adapted to be successful, so it is likely to be hearty in a greater number of unpredictable environments.
