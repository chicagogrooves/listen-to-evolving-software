## The Rise of Cargo-Culting

Since we are at a loss to deterministically explain the world around us, we naturally fall back to less precise measures.
One of them is the cognitive crutch of anecdotal prediction "The last time X happened, Y followed. X just happened, therefore Y is sure to follow !".

In the South Pacific islands after WWI, the islanders whose islands had been taken over, and had temporary airports built on them,
began to miss the planes flying in and out after the war. The planes had brought food, and since they stopped landing on the now-overgrown airports, times were tougher. So to lure the planes to land, they made bamboo control towers, and wore coconut headphones to reproduce all the airport-related activity that clearly caused the planes to land their before !

We invent explanations, and sometimes they work and other times they don't because they were never really put to the test, or their failures were overlooked due to selective attention. Our brains are prediction machines, we will always choose to have AN explanation rather than NO explanation.

While we may look down our noses at people whose explanations of the world's actions seem to have such "obvious" flaws, we should ask ourselves what we think is so special about us that we could not ever get caught-up in some wildly inaccurate, yet un-questioned assumptions.
