This quote by George Bernard Shaw stopped me dead in my tracks when I was running one day. I had to back up the audio book, play it again, and repeat each line aloud as they were read. It's one of my favorite affirmations in life.

"This is the true joy in life. That being used for a purpose, recognized by yourself as a mighty one; *that being a force of nature*, instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy..

I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community. And as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die. For the harder I work, the more I live.

I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It's a sort of splendid torch, which I've got a hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations."

My takeaways from this quote:
 - This world is not of our creation, we are just passing through - but we might as well do some good passing through.
 - To align one's purposes with Nature's own purposes turns one into a force of nature.
 - To be out-of-alignment with natural principles is to labor to push back the tide - which only makes a person bitter, exhausted, and ill.

At the end of the day, my goal is not to write programs, not to wax philosophical on Computing or Mathematics theory. It's to mean something to the people in my life I'm fortunate enough to have touched. It's to have fun surfing this gigantic wave of change that is passing through our lives right now and only growing in its tidal forces.

I hope people can see the opportunity in this time, and also the reasons to be cautious. I hope humanity can live harmoniously with the waves of change it makes. I hope you'll be inspired to do your part to understand and harness the tremendous amount of potential energy out there, and use it for the good of those around you. I hope the torch we pass is brighter still then the one we've been handed.

God speed, now go Listen for your next move !
