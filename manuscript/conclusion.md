# In Conclusion

This quote by George Bernard Shaw stopped me dead in my tracks when I was running one day. I had to back up the audio book, play it again, and repeat each line aloud as they were read. It's one of my favorite affirmations in life.

"This is the true joy in life. That being used for a purpose, recognized by yourself as a mighty one; that being *a force of nature*, instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.."

My takeaways from this quote are:
 - To align one's purposes with Nature's own purposes turns one into a force of nature.
 - To be out-of-alignment with natural principles is to labor to push back the tide - which only makes a person bitter, exhausted, and ill.

At the end of the day, my goal is not to write programs, not to wax philosophical on Computing or Mathematics theory. It's to mean something to the people in my life I'm fortunate enough to have been touched by. It's to have fun surfing this gigantic wave of change that is passing through our lives right now and only growing in its tidal forces.

I hope people can see the opportunity in this time, and also the reasons to be cautious. I hope humanity can live harmoniously with the waves of change. I hope you'll be inspired to do your part to understand and harness the tremendous amount of potential energy out there, and use it for the good of those around you. I hope the torch we pass is brighter still then the one we've been handed.

God speed, and now Go Listen for your next move!
